# CrossPlatformTriangleRendering
Your code sets up a cross-platform rendering pipeline using OpenGL for Android and Metal for iOS. It includes utility functions for shader management, buffer setup, and rendering logic. The OpenGL code handles vertex buffer and shader setup for drawing a triangle, while the Metal code initializes GPU resources and renders a triangle using Metal's pipeline state, command queue, and buffer management. The project is structured with conditional compilation to ensure the appropriate platform-specific rendering logic is executed on each platform.
